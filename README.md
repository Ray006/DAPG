# DAPG

This code is based on the project https://github.com/aravindr93/hand_dapg. 

So to run it, you need to install the corresponding environment.

The code is just for showing us the agent's action space by a visualized way, since it has a large action space(30-D).

The agent will move its hand joint one by one until 30th joint.
